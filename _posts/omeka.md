# Omeka Resource Guide {#title}
## Brief
Omeka is a web-based publishing tool for digital collections. It shines with images, sound, video, and rich metadata. Because it's not something you install on your computer but rather a web server, it provides a platform for groups of people to work together on the same resources at the same time, requiring only a web browser. Omeka is a great tool for group instruction activities in the classroom.

## Overview
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that has become one of the most popular languages for data analysis, web development, and machine learning. It was first created in 1991 by Guido van Rossum and has since been continuously developed and improved by a large and vibrant community of developers around the world.

Python is known for its simplicity and ease of use, making it an excellent choice for beginners who are just starting to learn how to program. It has a very readable syntax that emphasizes the use of plain English words and phrases, making it easy to understand and write code in.

One of the key features of Python is its use of indentation to denote blocks of code. Unlike many other programming languages that use brackets or other special characters to delimit code blocks, Python uses the amount of whitespace at the beginning of a line to determine which statements belong together. This feature has been both praised and criticized, but it remains one of the defining characteristics of Python and contributes to its readability and simplicity.

Another strength of Python is its support for a wide range of programming paradigms. It can be used as a procedural language, an object-oriented language, a functional language, or any combination of these. This flexibility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from small scripts to large, complex projects.

Python is also highly portable, with versions available for almost every platform, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and many others. This means that developers can write code on one platform and run it on another without having to worry about compatibility issues.

One of the key reasons for Python's popularity is its extensive library of modules and packages. These libraries contain pre-written code that can be imported into your own programs, saving you time and effort. Some of the most popular libraries include NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn, which are widely used in data analysis and machine learning applications.

Python is also commonly used in web development, with frameworks like Django and Flask providing a powerful and flexible platform for building web applications. These frameworks provide tools for handling common web development tasks like routing, templating, and database integration, allowing developers to focus on building the core features of their applications.
