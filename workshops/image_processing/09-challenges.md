In this episode, we will provide a final challenge for you to attempt,
based on all the skills you have acquired so far.
This challenge will be related to the shape of objects in images (*morphometrics*).

## Morphometrics: Bacteria Colony Counting

As mentioned in [the workshop introduction]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/01-introduction.md %}),
your morphometric challenge is to determine how many bacteria colonies are in
each of these images:

![Colony image 1](../fig/colonies-01.jpg)

![Colony image 2](../fig/colonies-02.jpg)

![Colony image 3](../fig/colonies-03.jpg)

The image files can be found at
`data/colonies-01.tif`,
`data/colonies-02.tif`,
and `data/colonies-03.tif`.

> ## Morphometrics for bacterial colonies
>
> Write a Python program that uses skimage to
> count the number of bacteria colonies in each image,
> and for each, produce a new image that highlights the colonies.
> The image should look similar to this one:
>
> ![Sample morphometric output](../fig/colonies-01-summary.png)
>
> Additionally, print out the number of colonies for each image.
>
> Use what you have learnt about [histograms]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/05-creating-histograms.md %}),
> [thresholding]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/07-thresholding.md %}) and
> [connected component analysis]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/08-connected-components.md %}).
> Try to put your code into a re-usable function,
> so that it can be applied easily to any image file.
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > First, let's work through the process for one image:
> > ~~~
> > import numpy as np
> > import imageio.v3 as iio
> > import skimage.color
> > import skimage.filters
> > import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
> > import ipympl
> > %matplotlib widget
> >
> > bacteria_image = iio.imread(uri="data/colonies-01.tif")
> >
> > # display the image
> > fig, ax = plt.subplots()
> > plt.imshow(bacteria_image)
> > ~~~
> > {: .language-python}
> >
> > ![Colony image 1](../fig/colonies-01.jpg)
> >
> > Next, we need to threshold the image to create a mask that covers only
> > the dark bacterial colonies.
> > This is easier using a grayscale image, so we convert it here:
> >
> > ~~~
> > gray_bacteria = skimage.color.rgb2gray(bacteria_image)
> >
> > # display the gray image
> > fig, ax = plt.subplots()
> > plt.imshow(gray_bacteria, cmap="gray")
> > ~~~
> > {: .language-python}
> >
> > ![Gray Colonies](../fig/colonies-01-gray.png)
> >
> > Next, we blur the image and create a histogram:
> >
> > ~~~
> > blurred_image = skimage.filters.gaussian(gray_bacteria, sigma=1.0)
> > histogram, bin_edges = np.histogram(blurred_image, bins=256, range=(0.0, 1.0))
> > fig, ax = plt.subplots()
> > plt.plot(bin_edges[0:-1], histogram)
> > plt.title("Graylevel histogram")
> > plt.xlabel("gray value")
> > plt.ylabel("pixel count")
> > plt.xlim(0, 1.0)
> > ~~~
> > {: .language-python}
> >
> > ![Histogram image](../fig/colonies-01-histogram.png)
> >
> > In this histogram, we see three peaks -
> > the left one (i.e. the darkest pixels) is our colonies,
> > the central peak is the yellow/brown culture medium in the dish,
> > and the right one (i.e. the brightest pixels) is the white image background.
> > Therefore, we choose a threshold that selects the small left peak:
> >
> > ~~~
> > mask = blurred_image < 0.2
> > fig, ax = plt.subplots()
> > plt.imshow(mask, cmap="gray")
> > ~~~
> > {: .language-python}
> >
> > ![Colony mask image](../fig/colonies-01-mask.png)
> >
> > This mask shows us where the colonies are in the image -
> > but how can we count how many there are?
> > This requires connected component analysis:
> >
> > ~~~
> > labeled_image, count = skimage.measure.label(mask, return_num=True)
> > print(count)
> > ~~~
> > {: .language-python}
> >
> > Finally, we create the summary image of the coloured colonies on top of
> > the grayscale image:
> >
> > ~~~
> > # color each of the colonies a different color
> > colored_label_image = skimage.color.label2rgb(labeled_image, bg_label=0)
> > # give our grayscale image rgb channels, so we can add the colored colonies
> > summary_image = skimage.color.gray2rgb(gray_bacteria)
> > summary_image[mask] = colored_label_image[mask]
> >
> > # plot overlay
> > fig, ax = plt.subplots()

> > You'll notice that for the images with more colonies, the results aren't perfect.
> > For example, some small colonies are missing,
> > and there are likely some small black spots being labelled incorrectly as colonies.
> > You could expand this solution to, for example,
> > use an automatically determined threshold for each image,
> > which may fit each better.
> > Also, you could filter out colonies below a certain size
> > (as we did in [the _Connected Component Analysis_ episode]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/08-connected-components.md %})).
> > You'll also see that some touching colonies are merged into one big colony.
