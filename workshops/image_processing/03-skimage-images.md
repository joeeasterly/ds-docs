We have covered much of how images are represented in computer software. In this episode we will learn some more methods
 for accessing and changing digital images.

## First, import the packages needed for this episode

~~~
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import ipympl
import imageio.v3 as iio
import skimage
import skimage.color
import skimage.transform
import skimage.util
~~~
{: .language-python}

## Reading, displaying, and saving images

Imageio provides intuitive functions for reading and writing (saving) images.
All of the popular image formats, such as BMP, PNG, JPEG, and TIFF are supported,
along with several more esoteric formats. Check the
[Supported Formats docs](https://imageio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/formats/index.html)
for a list of all formats.
Matplotlib provides a large collection of plotting utilities.

Let us examine a simple Python program to load, display,
and save an image to a different format.
Here are the first few lines:

~~~
"""
 * Python program to open, display, and save an image.
 *
"""
# read image
image = iio.imread(uri="data/chair.jpg")
~~~
{: .language-python}

We use the `iio.imread()` function to read a JPEG image entitled **chair.jpg**.
Imageio reads the image, converts it from JPEG into a NumPy array,
and returns the array; we save the array in a variable named `image`.

Next, we will do something with the image:

~~~
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plt.imshow(image)
~~~
{: .language-python}

Once we have the image in the program,
we first call `plt.subplots()` so that we will have
a fresh figure with a set of axis independent from our previous calls.
Next we call `plt.imshow()` in order to display the image.

Now, we will save the image in another format:

~~~
# save a new version in .tif format
iio.imwrite(uri="data/chair.tif", image=image)
~~~
{: .language-python}

The final statement in the program, `iio.imwrite(uri="data/chair.tif", image=image)`,
writes the image to a file named `chair.tif` in the `data/` directory.
The `imwrite()` function automatically determines the type of the file,
based on the file extension we provide.
In this case, the `.tif` extension causes the image to be saved as a TIFF.

> ## Metadata, revisited
>
> Remember, as mentioned in the previous section, _images saved with `imwrite()`
> will not retain all metadata associated with the original image
> that was loaded into Python!_
> If the image metadata is important to you, be sure to **always keep an unchanged
> copy of the original image!**
{: .callout }

> ## Extensions do not always dictate file type
>
> The `iio.imwrite()` function automatically uses the file type we specify in
> the file name parameter's extension.
> Note that this is not always the case.
> For example, if we are editing a document in Microsoft Word,
> and we save the document as `paper.pdf` instead of `paper.docx`,
> the file *is not* saved as a PDF document.
{: .callout}

> ## Named versus positional arguments
>
> When we call functions in Python,
> there are two ways we can specify the necessary arguments.
> We can specify the arguments *positionally*, i.e.,
> in the order the parameters appear in the function definition,
> or we can use *named arguments*.
>
> For example, the `iio.imwrite()`
> [function definition](https://imageio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_autosummary/imageio.v3.imwrite.html)
> specifies two parameters,
> the resource to save the image to (e.g., a file name, an http address) and
> the image to write to disk.
> So, we could save the chair image in the sample code above
> using positional arguments like this:
>
> `iio.imwrite("data/chair.tif", image)`
>
> Since the function expects the first argument to be the file name,
> there is no confusion about what `"data/chair.jpg"` means. The same goes
> for the second argument.
>
> The style we will use in this workshop is to name each argument, like this:
>
> `iio.imwrite(uri="data/chair.tif", image=image)`
>
> This style will make it easier for you to learn how to use the variety of
> functions we will cover in this workshop.

> Add `import skimage.transform` and `import skimage.util` to your list of imports.

> ~~~
> {: .language-python}
>
> As it is used here,

## Manipulating pixels

In [the _Image Basics_ episode]({{page.root}}{% link _episodes/02-image-basics.md %}),
we individually manipulated the colours of pixels by changing the numbers stored
in the image's NumPy array. Let's apply the principles learned there
along with some new principles to a real world example.

Suppose we are interested in this maize root cluster image.
We want to be able to focus our program's attention on the roots themselves,
while ignoring the black background.

![Root cluster image](../data/maize-root-cluster.jpg)

Since the image is stored as an array of numbers,
we can simply look through the array for pixel colour values that are
less than some threshold value.
This process is called *thresholding*,
and we will see more powerful methods to perform the thresholding task in
[the _Thresholding_ episode]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/07-thresholding.md %}).
Here, though, we will look at a simple and elegant NumPy method for thresholding.
Let us develop a program that keeps only the pixel colour values in an image
that have value greater than or equal to 128.
This will keep the pixels that are brighter than half of "full brightness",
i.e., pixels that do not belong to the black background.

We will start by reading the image and displaying it.

> ## Loading images with `imageio`: Read-only arrays
When loading an image with `imageio`, in certain situations the image is stored in a read-only array. If you attempt to manipulate the pixels in a read-only array, you will receive an error message `ValueError: assignment destination is read-only`. In order to make the image array writeable, we can create a copy with `image = np.array(image)` before manipulating the pixel values.
{: .callout}

~~~
"""
* Python script to ignore low intensity pixels in an image.
*
"""

# read input image
image = iio.imread(uri="data/maize-root-cluster.jpg")
image = np.array(image)

# display original image
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plt.imshow(image)
~~~
{: .language-python}


Now we can threshold the image and display the result.

~~~
# keep only high-intensity pixels
image[image < 128] = 0

# display modified image
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plt.imshow(image)
~~~
{: .language-python}

The NumPy command to ignore all low-intensity pixels is `image[image < 128] = 0`.
Every pixel colour value in the whole 3-dimensional array with a value less
that 128 is set to zero.
In this case,
the result is an image in which the extraneous background detail has been removed.

![Thresholded root image](../fig/maize-root-cluster-threshold.jpg)


## Converting colour images to grayscale

It is often easier to work with grayscale images, which have a single channel,
instead of colour images, which have three channels.
Skimage offers the function `skimage.color.rgb2gray()` to achieve this.
This function adds up the three colour channels in a way that matches
human colour perception,
see [the skimage documentation for details](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.color.html#skimage.color.rgb2gray).
It returns a grayscale image with floating point values in the range from 0 to 1.
We can use the function `skimage.util.img_as_ubyte()` in order to convert it back to the
original data type and the data range back 0 to 255.
Note that it is often better to use image values represented by floating point values,
because using floating point numbers is numerically more stable.

> ## Colour and `color`
>
> The Carpentries generally prefers UK English spelling,
> which is why we use "colour" in the explanatory text of this lesson.
> However, `skimage` contains many modules and functions that include
> the US English spelling, `color`.
> The exact spelling matters here,
> e.g. you will encounter an error if you try to run `skimage.colour.rgb2gray()`.
> To account for this, we will use the US English spelling, `color`,
> in example Python code throughout the lesson.
> You will encounter a similar approach with "centre" and `center`.
{: .callout }

~~~
"""
* Python script to load a color image as grayscale.
*
"""

# read input image
image = iio.imread(uri="data/chair.jpg")

# display original image
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plt.imshow(image)

# convert to grayscale and display
gray_image = skimage.color.rgb2gray(image)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plt.imshow(gray_image, cmap="gray")
~~~
{: .language-python}

We can also load colour images as grayscale directly by
passing the argument `mode="L"` to `iio.imread()`.

~~~
"""
* Python script to load a color image as grayscale.
*
"""

# read input image, based on filename parameter
image = iio.imread(uri="data/chair.jpg", mode="L")

# display grayscale image
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plt.imshow(image, cmap="gray")
~~~
{: .language-python}

The first argument to `iio.imread()` is the filename of the image.
The second argument `mode="L"` determines the type and range of the pixel values in the image (e.g., an 8-bit pixel has a range of 0-255). This argument is forwarded to the `pillow` backend, a Python imaging library for which mode "L" means 8-bit pixels and single-channel (i.e., grayscale). The backend used by `iio.imread()` may be specified as an optional argument: to use `pillow`, you would
pass `plugin="pillow"`. If the backend is not specified explicitly, `iio.imread()` determines the backend to use based on the image type.

> ## Loading images with `imageio`: Pixel type and depth
> When loading an image with `mode="L"`, the pixel values are stored as 8-bit integer numbers that can take values in the range 0-255. However, pixel values may also be stored with other types and ranges. For example, some `skimage` functions return the pixel values as floating point numbers in the range 0-1. The type and range of the pixel values are important for the colorscale when plotting, and for masking and thresholding images as we will see later in the lesson. If you are unsure about the type of the pixel values, you can inspect it with `print(image.dtype)`. For the example above, you should find that it is `dtype('uint8')` indicating 8-bit integer numbers.

## Access via slicing

As noted in the previous lesson skimage images are stored as NumPy arrays,
so we can use array slicing to select rectangular areas of an image.
Then, we can save the selection as a new image, change the pixels in the image,
and so on.
It is important to
remember that coordinates are specified in *(ry, cx)* order and that colour values
are specified in *(r, g, b)* order when doing these manipulations.

Consider this image of a whiteboard, and suppose that we want to create a
sub-image with just the portion that says "odd + even = odd," along with the
red box that is drawn around the words.

![Whiteboard image](../data/board.jpg)

Using the same display technique we have used throughout this course,
we can determine the coordinates of the corners of the area we wish to extract
by hovering the mouse near the points of interest and noting the coordinates.
If we do that, we might settle on a rectangular
area with an upper-left coordinate of *(135, 60)*
and a lower-right coordinate of *(480, 150)*,
as shown in this version of the whiteboard picture:

![Whiteboard coordinates](../fig/board-coordinates.jpg)

Note that the coordinates in the preceding image are specified in *(cx, ry)* order.
Now if our entire whiteboard image is stored as an skimage image named `image`,
we can create a new image of the selected region with a statement like this:

`clip = image[60:151, 135:481, :]`

Our array slicing specifies the range of y-coordinates or rows first, `60:151`,
and then the range of x-coordinates or columns, `135:481`.
Note we go one beyond the maximum value in each dimension,
so that the entire desired area is selected.
The third part of the slice, `:`,
indicates that we want all three colour channels in our new image.

A script to create the subimage would start by loading the image:

~~~
"""
 * Python script demonstrating image modification and creation via
 * NumPy array slicing.
"""

# load and display original image
image = iio.imread(uri="data/board.jpg")
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plt.imshow(image)
~~~
{: .language-python}

Then we use array slicing to
create a new image with our selected area and then display the new image.

~~~
# extract, display, and save sub-image
clip = image[60:151, 135:481, :]
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plt.imshow(clip)
iio.imwrite(uri="data/clip.tif", image=clip)
~~~
{: .language-python}

We can also change the values in an image, as shown next.

~~~
# replace clipped area with sampled color
color = image[330, 90]
image[60:151, 135:481] = color
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plt.imshow(image)
~~~
{: .language-python}

First, we sample a single pixel's colour at a particular location of the
image, saving it in a variable named `color`,
which creates a 1 × 1 × 3 NumPy array with the blue, green, and red colour values
for the pixel located at *(ry = 330, cx = 90)*.
Then, with the `img[60:151, 135:481] = color` command,
we modify the image in the specified area.
From a NumPy perspective,
this changes all the pixel values within that range to array saved in
the `color` variable.
In this case, the command "erases" that area of the whiteboard,
replacing the words with a beige colour,
as shown in the final image produced by the program:
