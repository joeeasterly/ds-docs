# What Can You Do with Your Account? #

What kinds of web projects you can create with Digital Scholar is mostly dictated by the borders of your imagination. That said, you might want to review some technical requirements and limitations.

Here are some ideas that might help you get started:

### Install a Web Application in Your Space

Digital Scholar makes installing applications in your web space very simple. Web applications are just special software that run on a web server. Usually, they allow you to build and manage a website. The kind of site you can build depends on the type of application you install.

**WordPress**: WordPress is a simple-to-use blogging application. The tool also comes with a _huge_ array of plugins & themes to allow you to create virtually any kind of website imaginably. We have guides on using WordPress **[here](#)**.

**Omeka:** Omeka is an open-source web application that can be used to create and display online digital collections and archives. We have information available to help you install and use Omeka **[here](#)**.

**Scalar:** Scalar is a content management system with the idea of creating non-linear books on the web. You can learn more about its functions and how to install it [**here#).

**Grav:** Grav is an open source, flat-file CMS made for folks who are looking for something a little more experimental. Grav provides a straightforward framework for creating pages and inserting media. We have additional resources for Grav **[here](#)**.

**![](#)Mediawiki:** It is the open-source wiki software that runs the online encyclopedia, [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/). This tool may be right for you if you’re interested in publishing documents and then collaborating with others on them. Find our guides on Mediawiki [**here**](http://www.stateu.org/docs/#mediawiki).

These are just a _few_ of the open-source applications that are available to you in your University of Rochester web space. We encourage you to read more about what Web applications are and which ones are available to you through this project.

### Organize Your Site with Subdomains and Folders

Through this project, you’ve received a domain name that you can actually subdivide and organize anyway you like. One easy way to organize your domain is to [create subdomains](http://stateu.org/docs/uncategorized/setting-up-subdomains/), in which you can then install other applications. In addition, you can just set up subfolders for your site (which can also have their own applications installed in them). Here’s an example of how you might organize your site (using the subdomain vs. the subfolder approach)

**Subdomain Approach**

**Subfolder Approach**

yourdomain.com (“root”)

Install WordPress as your “main site”

yourdomain.com (“root”)

course1.yourdomain.com

Install a second WordPress instance for a course you’re taking

yourdomain.com/course1

photos.yourdomain.com

Install ZenPhoto for a public photo gallery of your photos

yourdomain.com/photos

docs.yourdomain.com

Install MediaWiki for a club you belong to that wants to collaboratively edit its bylaws

yourdomain.com/docs

files.yourdomain.com

Install OwnCloud so you can access your files on your laptop and at work

yourdomain.com/files

This is just an _example_ of a way to organize your site and then use different sections to do different things. There is no one solution to this challenge, and what you do should be driven by what makes sense to you. To start, you may just want to install one thing at the “root” of your domain, and then let the rest evolve as you get to know more about what’s possible.

### Map Your Domain (or a Subdomain)

If you already have a digital presence that you’d like to pull into your Haverford Sites space, [domain mapping](http://stateu.org/docs/uncategorized/what-is-domain-mapping/) is an option you may wish to explore. This allows you to assign your domain (or a subdomain) to another service. Some services that work with domain mapping are:

*   [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/)
*   [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/)
*   [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/)
*   [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/)

When you map a domain, users who visit your URL will automatically see your space on one of these services. It’s a great way to incorporate your activity elsewhere into your domain, and it might be a good first step if you’ve already established a presence somewhere else and just want to point your new domain to that space.
