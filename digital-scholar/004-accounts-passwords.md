Understanding Accounts and Passwords
====================================

One aspect of Digital Scholar that may need clarification
is the different kinds of accounts involved in operating a digital
scholarship project.

Your NetID
----------

[NetID](https://tech.rochester.edu/services/netid/) is the
University of Rochester&lsquo;s single sign-on system for Blackboard, UR
Gmail, VPN, and many others. Your NetID is also the easiest (but not
only) way to access your Digital Scholar account dashboard, called
*cPanel*. To log in, go to
[https://digitalscholar.rochester.edu](https://digitalscholar.rochester.edu/)
and click **Log in**.

Your cPanel account
-------------------

When you first registered with Digital Scholar, you used your NetID. At
the time of registration, Digital Scholar automatically created an
additional local[^1] username and password set so you can directly
access cPanel without needing to use your NetID credentials. This is
especially useful for students who are graduating and others who may
lose access to their NetID.

[^1]: *local* means unique to that particular software, in this case,
cPanel. The opposite of a local account is a [single sign-on
(SSO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on)
account, such as
[NetID](https://tech.rochester.edu/services/netid/) or
[Active
Directory](https://tech.rochester.edu/services/active-directory).
With a local account, you can generally use whatever username you wish
and whatever password as well, even if you use the same username on
another system. Changing your password on one system will not change the
password for a local account on another system.

Your application administrator accounts
---------------------------------------

Every time you install a new application in cPanel, a separate
administrator account just for that application is created. You will
likely use these accounts very often. Every time you need to log in to
your application to manage the associated website, you will use this
account.

For example, if you install WordPress to manage your Web site, every
time you need to add content to WordPress, change your theme, approve
comments, etc., you will use this account to log in.

Usually, you will be given the opportunity to choose the username and
password for that account. We recommend choosing something easy to
remember but [solid and
secure](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/choosing-and-protecting-passwords).

Upon installation, you will likely receive an email confirming the
user-id/password combination you chose. It will also have information
about how to access the login page for that application. You may wish to
make sure you don&rsquo;t delete this message.

Depending on the application you\'re working with, managing and
resetting the password for this account will vary. If you\'ve used
Installatron (in cPanel) to install the application, however, you can
always review the account credentials:

- Login to cPanel through [https://digitalscholar.rochester.edu/dashboard/](https://digitalscholar.rochester.edu/dashboard/)
- Click the Installatron icon in the Software/Services section.
- Find the application you installed under **My Applications**.
- Click the **Edit** button (this looks like a blue wrench).
- Scroll down to find the Administrator Username and Password.

For the most part, any application you install that requires a username
and password will have a password reset feature as well. For more

Other Types of Accounts
-----------------------

In addition to the account types outlined above, there are a few other
kinds of accounts you may have as part of digitalscholar.rochester.edu:

- When you sign up for a domain on Digital Scholar, cPanel will automatically create an **FTP** account for you by default.
- You&lsquo;ll also have the option of manually creating your own FTP account.
-   Application User Accounts: In addition to the Administrator Account that you set up when installing an application, most applications will also let you set up user profile accounts within each application.
