Option 1: Free Subdomain
------------------------

For no cost, you can create a subdomain of digitalscholar.rochester.edu.

To create a free subdomain of digitalscholar.rochester.edu, leave this default option selected and enter the subdomain name you want for your website. When you’ve found an available subdomain, click the button labeled “Continue.”

Confirm that you like the name you selected. If you do, click the “signup” button. (If not, click the “start over” button, and repeat the above step.)

![](003-click_signup.png)You should now see a screen confirming that your subdomain is ready. After a few seconds, you will see the regular cPanel options.

Option 2: Buy a top-level domain from Reclaim Hosting
-----------------------------------------------------

It is easy to create your own top-level domain. This allows you to select a URL for your website that is easy to remember and share.

While you are at University of Rochester, this is available for a nominal cost (currently $12/year). You can continue to use this domain after leaving Digital Scholar, although the cost may increase.

To create a top-level domain, selected “Register a new domain” and enter the name you want for your website. Click the button labeled “Continue.”

The system will make sure your selected name is available. When you see a message that the name is available, select the number of years you are registering the domain name and click the “Continue” button.

![](http://www.stateu.org/docs/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/5.png)You will now see the new name, along with an invoice. Confirm that everything is the way you want it, and click the “Sign Up” button–or click the “Start Over” button and return to the above step.
