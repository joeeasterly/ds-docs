1.  To get started you’ll need to login to your control panel ([https://digitalscholar.rochester.edu/dashboard](https://digitalscholar.rochester.edu/dashboard "https://digitalscholar.rochester.edu/dashboard")) using your University of Rochester username and password.![](http://www.stateu.org/docs/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/login.png)

3.  When you click on the Scalar icon, you will be taken to the Scalar information page. Click **install this application**.![install Scalar](http://sites.haverford.edu/docs/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/4.3-scalar-installatron-install.gif)
4.  On the next page, fill in the different fields accordingly:  
    \-Select the domain or sub-domain where you’d like your Scalar site to live. You can create a sub-domain by following directions in the section [Setting up Subdomain](http://stateu.org/docs/uncategorized/setting-up-subdomains/). The directory is optional. If you are using a sub-domain, you may not need to use a sub-directory. You can learn more by reading [Subdomains vs Subdirectories](http://stateu.org/docs/uncategorized/subdomains-vs-subdirectories/).

    \-Under **version**, select the version that is most recent.  
    \-By default the installer will automatically backup your website and update it anytime a new version comes out. While we recommend you keep this option, it is possible to only do minor updates, or turn them off completely.  
    \-The installer will also create a database for you automatically, but if you’ve already created one for this website you can choose **Let me manage the database settings** and enter the details.

    \-Finally, in Settings, you’ll need to create a username and password for the Scalar install. A password can be generated for you, but you should try to create your own.
5.  Click **Install**.
6.  Once the installer is finished loading, you will be taken to the **My Apps** section of the dashboard. Here you’ll find links to login to your scalar installation.
