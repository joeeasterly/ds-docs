## Choosing Your Subdomain Name #

Your subdomain name, (i.e., _yourname_.digitalscholar.rochester.edu) that can be used to build out your own digital presence. As you make your choice, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:

- **Your Domain Name Must Be Available**: Domain names must be unique, which means in order for you to claim your own, you need to be sure that it is currently available (and not being used by anyone else or any company or organization). There are lots of tools to check on domain availability, and when you sign up on digitalscholar.rochester.edu, we’ll actually check the availability of your choice for you. If you’d like to spend some time thinking about your choice and checking availability before you actually sign-up, we recommend using [ICANN Lookup](https://lookup.icann.org/). Note: If you are interested in a domain name ending in something other than .com, .org, or .net, it may be available through the registrar associated with that domain "extension" (a.k.a top-level domain). For a list of domain extensions and their associated registrars, see the [IANA Root Zone Database](https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db) or contact the Digital Scholarship Department for assistance.
- **Your domain name should only include letters, numbers, and hyphens**: While it is possible for domain names to include other characters, we strongly recommend against using them.
- **Choose a Domain You Can Live With**: You should choose a domain name that you feel you can live with for quite some time. **You should pick something that you won’t find embarrassing in the future.** A good rule of thumb is to pick a domain that you would be comfortable putting on a future job application.
- **You May Wish to Include Your Name in Your Domain**: There is no requirement that your domain reflects your specific identity in the form of your first and last name. However, choosing a domain name that includes your name may make it easier for you to achieve higher rankings in search engines when someone queries your real name. At the University of Rochester, it is common for people to use their personal name as their subdomain. For example, Professor Jane Doe has a digital scholar account at https://janedoe.digitalscholar.rochester.edu. They maintain a CV at https://janedoe.digitalscholar.rochester.edu/cv and a blog at https://janedoe.digitalscholar.rochester.edu/blog. Each year, Jane teaches a culinary history course and uses digital scholar to host a class project, Digital Escoffier. This project uses an additional subdomain in the URL, and stores each year's work in their own folder, e.g., https://escoffier.janedoe.digitalscholar.rochester.edu/2019, https://escoffier.janedoe.digitalscholar.rochester.edu/2020, etc.
- **Pick a Domain you Like**: At the end of the day, your domain should reflect you. Pick a domain you like and are proud of. It can reflect your interests, sports you play, or your hobby. Or it could just be your name. The “right” domain for you is the one you’re comfortable with.
- **You can always change your domain name if you have to**: If you decide that you want to change your domain, you can do so. You can even move part of your website onto its own domain. For example, if Professor Jane Doe's Digital Escoffier project expands to include courses from multiple departments, then that project could be linked to its own URL, https://digital-escoffier.org without changing the server..

## What's in a URL?
![](/images/002-url.png)
A. Protocol: The protocol is the method used to access the resource. The most common protocol is HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol), which is used to access Web pages. Other protocols include FTP (File Transfer Protocol), which is used to transfer files over the Internet, and HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure), which is used to access Web pages over a secure connection.

B. Subdomain: The subdomain is the part of the domain name that is located to the left of the domain name. For example, in the URL http://www.rochester.edu, the subdomain is www. The subdomain is also sometimes referred to as the host name.

C. Domain Name: The domain name is the unique name that identifies a Web site. For example, the domain name for the University of Rochester is rochester.edu. The domain name is also sometimes referred to as the host name.

D. Top-Level Domain: The top-level domain is the part of the domain name that is located to the right of the domain name. For example, in the URL http://www.rochester.edu, the top-level domain is .edu. The top-level domain is also sometimes referred to as the domain extension.

E. Host: The host is the computer on which the resource is located. For example, in the URL http://www.rochester.edu/college/eng/, the host is www.rochester.edu.

F. Path: The path is the part of the URL that is located to the right of the domain name. For example, in the URL http://www.rochester.edu/college/eng/, the path is /college/eng/. The path sometimes refers to a specific file or folder on the Web server, but it can also refer to a specific page on a Web site.
