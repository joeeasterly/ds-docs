# Privacy

What content you add to your web space on Digital Scholar is entirely up to you. 
## Domain Names
How you name your domain is also entirely up to you. If you choose to keep a subdomain &mdash; for example, *bluesky*.digitalscholar.rochester.edu &mdash; that name is registered only with the University of Rochester's [name servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_server), and we do not disclose the owner of that name. However, if you choose to register your own primary domain (e.g., *bluesky.us*), the [registrar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registrar) you purcahsed the domain from may make your contact information available in a public directory such as [ICANN WHOIS](https://lookup.icann.org/en/lookup). Most registrars allow private WHOIS records, and many will charge an additional fee for that service. Reclaim Hosting, the service provider behind Digital Scholar, offers private registrations for free.

If you choose to keep a digitalscholar.rochester.edu subdomain, then cost (as long as you remain affiliated with the University) and privacy are not concerns.
